# WimaxForPalestine
So this website was the hard work , for nearly one day to participate in a Hackathon "Code for Qods", to make solutions for our brothers abd sisters in palestine ...

Inspiration
We believe that everyone deserves access to the internet, and we are committed to helping our Palestinians brothers in Gaza to achieve this basic human right.

What it does
Is To Offer a solution to solve the internet issue for our brothers in Palestine “Gaza and west Bank ”.

What's next for Untitled
Suggest a network topology that can help us achieve the requirements. Suggest a protocol or method to help integrate existing hardware in Gaza. Work with us as support mentors to solve problems during implementation.

Our Goal 
Is simply make an alternative internet or an offline mode in the warzone to help our brothers there in their fight , by looking for contributers ansd supporters who are willing to help us to 
implement the WIMAX technology there (the alternative of the internet) , to help gathering and transferring data there .

AND THANK YOU .
