# WimaxForPalestine
So this website was the hard work , for nearly one day to participate in a Hackathon "Code for Qods", to make solutions for our brothers abd sisters in palestine ...

Inspiration:
We believe that everyone deserves access to the internet, and we are committed to helping our Palestinians brothers in Gaza to achieve this basic human right.

What it does:
Is To Offer a solution to solve the internet issue for our brothers in Palestine “Gaza and west Bank ”.

What's next for Untitled:
Suggest a network topology that can help us achieve the requirements. Suggest a protocol or method to help integrate existing hardware in Gaza. Work with us as support mentors to solve problems during implementation.

Our Goal :
Is simply make an alternative internet or an offline mode in the warzone to help our brothers there in their fight , by looking for contributers ansd supporters who are willing to help us to 
implement the WIMAX technology there (the alternative of the internet) , to help gathering and transferring data there .

AND THANK YOU .
